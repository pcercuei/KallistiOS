    Generally, you should prefer interacting with the higher level standard C
    functions, like time(), rather than these when simply needing to fetch the
    current system time.

    \brief        Real-Time Clock (RTC) Management
    \ingroup      timing

    Provides an API for fetching and managing the date/time using
    the hardware real-time clock (RTC). All timestamps are in standard
    Unix format, with an epoch of January 1, 1970. Due to the fact
    that there is no time zone data on the RTC, all times are expected
    to be in the local time zone.

    \note
    For reading the current date/time, you should favor the standard C,
    C++, or POSIX functions, as they are platform-indpendent and are
    calculating current time based on a cached boot time plus a delta
    that is maintained by the timer subsystem, rather than actually
    having to requery the RTC, so they are faster.
