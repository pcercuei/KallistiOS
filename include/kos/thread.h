/** \defgroup kthreads KThreads
    \brief    KOS Native Threading API
    \ingroup  threading

    The thread scheduler itself is a relatively simplistic priority scheduler.
    There is no provision for priorities to erode over time, so keep that in
    mind. That practically means that if you have 2 high priority threads that
    are always runnable and one low priority thread that is always runnable, the
    low priority thread will never actually run (since it will never get to the
    front of the run queue because of the high priority threads).

    The scheduler supports two distinct types of threads: joinable and detached
    threads. A joinable thread is one that can return a value to the creating
    thread (or for that matter, any other thread that wishes to join it). A
    detached thread is one that is completely detached from the rest of the
    system and cannot return values by "normal" means. Detached threads
    automatically clean up all of the internal resources associated with the
    thread when it exits. Joinable threads, on the other hand, must keep some
    state available for the ability to return values. To make sure that all
    memory allocated by the thread's internal structures gets freed, you must
    either join with the thread (with thd_join()) or detach it (with
    thd_detach()). The old KOS threading system only had what would be
    considered detached threads.
