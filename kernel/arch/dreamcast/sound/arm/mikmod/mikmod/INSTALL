INSTALL file for mikmod
=======================

COMPILE USING CMAKE :
=====================

Mikmod versions 3.2.5 and newer support CMake.  CMake version 2.8.x
or later is required.  CMake homepage is at http://www.cmake.org/ .

Run:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake-gui ..         # For the GUI configuration applet

Or:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ccmake ..            # For the Curses-based configuration applet

With a fallback to:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..             # Non-interactive application.

You need libmikmod compiled and installed on your system.

For installing under windows, consult the CMake documentation for
generating a Visual C, MinGW, etc. compatible makefile or project.


COMPILE USING CONFIGURE / AUTOTOOLS :
=====================================

In most systems just run:
 $ ./configure
 $ make

You need GNU make.  On BSD or SysV systems, you may need to use gmake
instead of make.  Use ./configure --help to see configuration options.
You need libmikmod compiled and installed on your system.  To install
mikmod, run "make install" as the superuser.

To cross-compile, you will need to use the --host option of configury.
For example:
 $ ./configure --host=powerpc-apple-darwin9  # for Mac OS X (powerpc)
 $ ./configure --host=i686-pc-mingw32        # for Windows (win32)
 $ ./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32     # for Windows (win64)

We also provide standalone makefiles for Windows, Mac OS X, DJGPP (DOS)
which you can use for both compiling on the relevant native system, or
for cross-compiling.
