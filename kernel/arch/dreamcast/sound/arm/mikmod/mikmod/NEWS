THANKS

- The winner of the ``it's rainy day, so I'll rewrite MikMod'' contest this
  time is Andrew Zabolotny. The colored MikMod looks great ! Thanks a lot !

- To Frank Loemker, who has done many changes since the last release in 1999,
  has improved the widget system a lot, added a file selector, theme support,
  improved the configuration routines, recursive directory scanning, made
  the player and library run in a separate thread, added win32 support
  (with lcc), fixed problems with DJGPP, and fixed a lot of small bugs.
  (please note that some of theses changes may have been done by
  Andrew Zabolotny. Frank Loemker sent me a big patch so I cannot know for
  sure who did what).


NEW FEATURES

- On terminals that support it, colors. There is a built-in theme editor
  in the configuration panel. Themes are loaded and saved from the
  config file. Set the environment variable TERM to mono to
  disable this under OS/2 and DOS.

- Mikmod will now display it's version and the song name or filename
  currently being played in the terminal title bar. On unix, there is
  support for xterm compatible title setting (rxvt, Eterm, aixterm,
  dtterm...), and a few others (iris-ansi, hpterm). It is also supported
  under win32.

- If using libmikmod 3.2, sample and instrument panels are dynamic, displaying
  which samples/instruments are currently played, and a volume panel displays
  volume bars and instruments/samples numbers.

- A file selector for the load/insert/save operations:
  - Marks files which are in the actual playlist.
  - Includes the possibility to add/remove any number of entries to/from
    the playlist.
  - Directories can be changed with cursor keys and with an input line.
  - Editable hotlist allows quick switching to preferred directories.
  - Recursive directory scanning if "Add" or "Toggle" is used if a
    directory is selected.

- Recursive directory scanning at startup with the option
    "-y, -di[rectory] dir  Scan directory recursively for modules".

- Threaded player (that is an own thread for MikMod_Update()),
  is switched off at compile time if the system supports no threads
  and at run tmie if libmikmod does not support threads.

- Better archive support
  - Support for archivers which need short file names
  - The definition of archivers is loaded from the config file.
  - Many other improvements.

- Of course, many bug fixes and clean ups.

PLATFORM SPECIFIC

- DOS is a supported platform again.
- Can be compiled on WIN32 with lcc
- Fixes for DJGPP
- the MIKMOD_SRAND_CONSTANT environment variable can be used to set the
  srandom() seed on UNIX platforms. Its primary intent is to assist in
  testing - see https://bitbucket.org/shlomif/mikmod-test-suite .


Summary of changes between MikMod 3.2.0 and MikMod 3.2.1:
================================================================

MikMod 3.2.1 was released on 07/10/2003

BUGFIXES

- Enable/disable color gui should have appeared in configuration dialog, 
  and On exit sub-menu in other options did not appear.

NEW FEATURES

- If a supported terminal is detected int the $TERM env var,
  MikMod will set the title bar with -= MikMod x.x.x =- followed by
  the song title between (). There is a configuration option for this
  in config->other_options


Summary of changes between MikMod 3.1.6 and MikMod 3.2.0:
================================================================

MikMod 3.2.0 was released on 04/10/2003

THANKS
- Info Saitz <ingo@debian.org>, the debian MikMod package maintainer for many bug fixes.

BUGFIXES

- Bugfixes from the debian MikMod package
  + cleaned up the documentation to match the output of the manpage,
  mikmod --help and the actual option processing.
  + Security fix when dealing with archives
  + Won't play LHA-compressed MODs with spaces in their names
  + Support for files with the extension prepended to the filename. Pretty
  common on Aminet. Maybe an Amiga convention?
  + Installed new versions of configure.{guess.sub} to support compiling on newer
  arches. They are taken from autotools-dev 20030110.1.

NEW FEATURES

- Color ncurse interface, and Option to enable/disable it.
- Option to quit MikMod automatically when the playlist is finished.


Summary of changes between MikMod 3.1.5 and MikMod 3.1.6 (Riom):
================================================================

MikMod 3.1.6 was released on 07/05/1999.


THANKS

- As usual, Frank Loemker contributed lots of stuff to the player. Thanks
  for your work.


BUGFIXES

- MikMod segfaulted when run as root (there was a public patch to 3.1.5 for
  this).

- The mono/stereo setting in the -output option was ignored.

- The frequency range was restricted to 8kHz-44.1kHz without reason.

- Loading playlist not located in the current directory should work now.


NEW FEATURES

- Interface is even more featured:
  * On-screen configuration panel.
  * Playlist sorting, loading files or playlists from the player.

- Added a restart module (R key) feature.


REMOVED FEATURES

- Support for the ARJ archiver has been dropped, as unarj needed an 'extra
  to stdout' extra feature, and the URL of the patch gave me an error 404
  recently... Besides, ARJ isn't widely used in the Unix world (perhaps because
  we don't like plagiarism...)


PLATFORM SPECIFIC

- Fixed a compilation problem on HP-UX systems lacking ncurses (HP-UX curses
  doesn't define KEY_END).



Summary of changes between MikMod 3.1.2 and MikMod 3.1.5 (Pradelles):
=====================================================================

MikMod 3.1.5 was released on 03/01/1999.

Starting from this version, the engine (libmikmod) and the module player
(MikMod) are made separate, to make the life easier for people who use
libmikmod and don't need the player.


THANKS

- The player was nearly completely rewritten by Frank Loemker. Nice job !

BUGFIXES

- If the player is interrupted while loading a compressed file, a temporary
  file was not removed.

- Dealing with archives containing a lot of files hanged the player at start
  (under Unix only).

- When playing from a playlist, the last file of the playlist was played twice.


NEW FEATURES

- Player now displays which information panels are available, and should
  look better with less than 80 character wide terminals.

- Bzip2 compressed modules, as well as tar and compressed tar archives, are
  recognized.

- MikMod now stores your default settings in $HOME/.mikmodrc, so you don't
  have to specify a butch of options each time you invoke MikMod.


Summary of changes between MikMod 3.1.1 and MikMod 3.1.2 (Monistrol):
=====================================================================

MikMod 3.1.2 was released on 12/07/1998.


THANKS

- For this version, the special thanks distinction is awarded to Michal Svec,
  Thomas Sailer and Winfried Scheibe. You guys rule !
  And as usual, thanks to all the people who submitted bug reports and helped
  me to get rid of'em.


BUG FIXES

- Due to an inverted test, the DSM loader rejected every valid DSM module.
- Surround panning was misunderstood by the DSM loader.
- FAR modules with more than 64 notes per pattern were incorrectly rejected.
- report whether an IT module was compressed or not wasn't accurate.
- STM identification test was broken and didn't reject some incorrect
  modules.
- A few glitches in the pattern break and pattern jump effect have been
  fixed (thanks to Firelight for his "Backwards" module which showed the
  problem !)
- The OSS driver had a serious memory allocation bug which could cause
  systematic coredumps, depending on your hardware and your environment
  variable settings.
- Archive support didn't work correctly with some versions of lharc (1.01,
  1.14c+) and unzip (5.40+), hopefully they should work now.


NEW FEATURES

- Support for rar archives has been added. The player looks for 'unrar' to
  display and extract the archives ; don't forget to put a symbolic link if
  you only have rar.


PLATFORM SPECIFIC

- The Sun audio driver didn't work correctly at 44100 Hz 16 bit stereo under
  Solaris, due to an incorrect default buffer size.
- The generated Makefiles for Watcom C++ under OS/2 were incorrect.
- When compiling with emx under OS/2, the optimization level was set too high
  and caused incorrect playback for some modules.


MISC

- I've found more DSM information to throw in the documentation.


Summary of changes between MikMod 3.1 and MikMod 3.1.1 (Landos):
================================================================

MikMod 3.1.1 was released on 12/02/1998.

This version contains only bugfixes and was released shortly after 3.1 because
of a really annoying bug in the error messages.


THANKS

- Special thanks to Scott Miller for his help in tracking a nasty bug.
  And as usual, thanks to all the people who submitted bug reports and helped
  me to get rid of'em.


BUG FIXES

- Due to a missing coma, most error message texts didn't correspond to what
  was really happening.
- MikMod 3.1 was too strict regarding the S3M speed effect and did not
  allow >32 speeds.
- The 15 instrument MOD loader has been made more robust by recognizing and
  some non module filetypes which could be misunderstood as valid modules and
  caused coredumps.
- IT effects S5x (set panbrello waveform), S7x (instrument/NNA commands) and
  SAx (set sample offset high part) were not processed correctly.
- Modules written by Impulse Tracker 2.14p3 in the uncompressed Impulse 2
  format could be rejected (detection routine had to be modified to cope with
  an IT2.14p3 save bug...)


PLATFORM SPECIFIC

- A bug in the configure script prevented MikMod from compiling correctly under
  IRIX, AIX and perhaps some other Unices.
- Another bug in the configure script caused the detection of esd_close() in
  libesd to always return true.
- The README.OS2 file was missing in 3.1


Summary of changes between MikMod 3.0.4 and MikMod 3.1 (Davayat):
=================================================================

MikMod 3.1 was released on 11/30/1998.


THANKS

- Many thanks to Bjornar Henden, Steve Martin, "MenTaLguY", Sebastiaan Megens
  and Thomas Neumann for their precise bug reports and bug fixes.
  Also thanks to all the people who submitted bug reports and helped me to
  make MikMod better.
  Thanks, guys !


BUG FIXES

- Panning overflows which resulted in extra noises of high volume )-: are
  now fixed.
- Surround mixer fixed.
- 669 pitch slides are rendered correctly now (used logarithmic periods before).
- FAR modules now play at correct speed, and more effects implemented.
- IT pitch envelope now works correctly.
- IT effect G (porta to note) misbehaviour when changing instrument on the same
  row, or after a note cut, fixed.
- IT volume column effect G was misunderstood (G0 was treated as G1, G1 as G2
  etc).
- Lots of bug fixes in MED loader. Should now play modules at correct speed, but
  still not perfect.
- Some notes were not played in MODs.
- Some effect fixes in ULT loader.
- The S3M volume slides were not rendered correctly.
- XM modules with more than 256 samples caused systematic coredumps when trying
  to load them.
- XM effect G (set global volume) was misinterpreted, resulting in halved
  volumes during playback.


NEW FEATURES

- MikMod now plays DMP's AMF files.
- A "curious" option has been added to look for extra patterns in MODs, S3Ms and
  ITs (useful for some Skaven's modules).
- MikMod now uses autoconf for building, and you can build a shared MikMod
  library.
- Programmer's documentation in texinfo format, suitable for online browsing
  (with GNU info) as well as printing. API function names made more consistant
  and more thematic.


PLATFORM SPECIFIC

- New driver for the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA).
- The EsounD driver has been improved and will attempt daemon reconnection on
  a regular time basis, should the esd been killed.
- The SGI driver caused coredumps on some machines ; hopefully this is now
  fixed.
- integrated OS/2 support, with a new DART driver for use under Warp 4 and CPU
  snagger feature.


MISC

- I was asked to put a copyright notice in MikMod. Although I don't like that,
  it seems that there has to be one to be sure the GPL and LGPL apply correctly.
  I really hate copyrighting free software I haven't entirely written...
- I've also shaved my beard the day before this release. Nice to see there was
  still skin under the thick beard (-:


Summary of changes between MikMod 3.0.3 and MikMod 3.0.4 (Combronde):
=====================================================================

MikMod 3.0.4 was released on 09/21/1998.

- 669 modules are now played at correct speed.
- MED loader pattern size bug fixed.
- MOD sample offsets (in file) computation fixed.
- S3M with more than 16 channels (i.e not created with Scream Tracker) caused
  previous version to coredump, but worked in 2.*
- End of song marker is now recognized in S3M and IT when it appears inside
  the pattern list.
- It was possible to register the same loader or driver twice and this made
  the library hang.
- Speed and Tempo can't escape their bounds (1-31 for speed, 32-255 for tempo)
  now.
- Delay note effect did not work correctly in previous version, but did in 2.*
- All divide by zero conditions are prevented.
- Archive code forgot to erase its temporary file (and had too short buffers).

    (http://www.tux.org/~ricdude/EsounD.html)
- New "volume fadeout" option.
- New "don't loop" option.
- Help screen in the curses player.
- Module time is displayed in the player.
- MikMod 2 banners are back.
- Randomized playlist can now be walked through correctly.


REMOVED FEATURES

- The Unimod format is not supported anymore (nobody used it, right ?). The
  MikCvt utility has been withdrawn, too. Both will be put back on request
  if someone really need them. Just ask !


PLATFORM SPECIFIC

- OpenBSD support, although in mono 8bit 8000 Hz only, but that's a start.
- Merged NetBSD and FreeBSD specific patches from their "ports collection".
- Player works with old AIX curses, as well as with old HP-UX curses.


MISC

- Rewritten building mechanism. It's not yet Autoconf, but it's coming...
- License terms are clear : LGPL for the library, GPL for the player.
