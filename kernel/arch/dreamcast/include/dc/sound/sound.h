    \brief   Low-level sound support and memory management.
    \ingroup audio_driver

    This file contains declarations for low-level sound operations and for SPU
    RAM pool memory management. Most of the time you'll be better off using the
    higher-level functionality in the sound effect support or streaming support,
    but this stuff can be very useful for some things.

    This function acts as the memory allocator for the SPU RAM pool. It acts
    much like one would expect a malloc() function to act, although it does not
    return a pointer directly, but rather an offset in SPU RAM.

    \param  size            The amount of memory to allocate, in bytes.
    
    \return                 The location of the start of the block on success,
