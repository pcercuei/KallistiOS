    \ingroup timers

    This file contains functions for interacting with the timer sources on the
    SH4. Many of these functions may interfere with thread operation or other
    such things, and should thus be used with caution. Basically, the only
    functionality that you might use in practice in here in normal programs is
    the gettime functions.

/** \defgroup timers    Timer Unit
    \brief              SH4 CPU peripheral providing timers and counters

    The Dreamcast's SH4 includes an on-chip Timer Unit (TMU) containing 3
    independent 32-bit channels (TMU0-TMU2). Each channel provides a
    down-counter with automatic reload and can be configured to use 1 of
    7 divider circuits for its input clock. By default, KOS uses the fastest
    input clock for each TMU channel, providing a maximum internal resolution
    of 80ns ticks.

    \warning
    Under normal circumstances, all 3 TMU channels are reserved by KOS for
    various OS-related purposes. If you need a free general-purpose interval
    timer, consider using the Watchdog Timer.

    \note
    90% of the time, you will never have a need to directly interact with this
    API, as it's mostly used as a kernel-level driver which backs other APIs.
    For example, querying for ticks, fetching the current timestamp, or putting
    a thread to sleep is typically done via the standard C, C++, or POSIX APIs.
